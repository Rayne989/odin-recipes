# odin-recipes

The aim of this current project is to create a bare-bones recipe website without any styling.

I will be using the information I have learnt up to this point to create links and have the pages link to one another, as well as using absolute links from the internet.

By the end of this project, I hope to be a bit more comfortable using Git and navigating a Mac.
